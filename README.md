A playarea for anything Python-related. These scripts are for demonstrative
purposes.

Powershell was initially used in development. Over time, scripts have started to
use bash via WSL Ubuntu since some tools do not work in Windows (like pyenv). No
guarantees or indications are made on the compatibility of scripts with either
shell.
